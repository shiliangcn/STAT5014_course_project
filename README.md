data showing enthusiams change? Is there social data available that might show trends? A few of the many

For this project, we plan to cluster the twiiter comments through K-means Clustering. This project contains folling steps:

- Step 1: Import the data.
- Step 2: Regular Expression to extract the content from the raw dataset. (early October)
- Step 3: Text Preprocessing and Cleaning the data.
- Step 4: Vectorization. (Mid-November)
- Step 5: Kmeans Clustering. (Before Mid-December)
